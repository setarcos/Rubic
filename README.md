This is a Rubic's Cube emulator written in C++. Some of the codes were
borrowed from [opengl-tutorials](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/).
It's just a program I'm using to test OpenGL features. No plans for where
it leads to. If you find those codes are useful or want to give some
advices, feel free to contact me.
